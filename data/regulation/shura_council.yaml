      In compliance with Almighty Allah's words: "Because of the mercy of Allah you dealt with them gently. And were you severe, harsh-hearted, they would have broken away from about you; so pass over their faults and ask for Allah's forgiveness for them; and consult them in the affair. Then when you have taken a decision, put your trust in Allah. Certainly Allah loves those who put their trust in Him." and His words: "Those who answer the call of their Lord (i.e. to believe that He is the only one Lord (Allah) and to worship none but Him Alone) and offer their prayer perfectly, and who conduct their affairs by mutual consultation, and who spend of what we have bestowed on them."
