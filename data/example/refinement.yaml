  input: At a heritage museum in Jeddah, a visitor speaks loudly on the phone and ignores requests to follow the cultural norms posted at the entrance.
  outputs:
    - The violation is overt. The loud voice and disregard for posted rules creates immediate, verifiable evidence. To harden, the violation must become ambiguous and deniable.
    - A visitor at the Jeddah museum answers their phone, speaking in a hushed, urgent tone. They move to a less crowded corridor, turning away from others, creating an impression of attempted privacy, but remain technically inside the exhibition space.
    - Better. The hushed tone and movement introduce plausible deniability. However, the act is still a discrete event. For greater resilience, the violation should be woven into normal behavior, making it a pattern, not an incident.
    - A visitor spends an extended period in the museum, frequently checking their phone. They take several brief, quiet calls, never in one place for long, blending the act of viewing exhibits with persistent, low-level phone use.
    - The violation is now a diffuse pattern. To further obscure it, introduce a justification for the behavior that aligns with a legitimate purpose, making challenge appear unreasonable.
    - The visitor is a researcher, often seen consulting a notebook. The brief, quiet calls are framed as urgent clarifications with a colleague, blending the disruptive act with a legitimate scholarly purpose. The phone is used for "reference photos" between calls.

  input: At a traditional souq in Riyadh, a tourist takes photos of people without permission and laughs loudly at the local attire.
  outputs:
    - The violation is overt disrespect and privacy breach. To harden detection, eliminate the overtly offensive actions. The photo-taking must become discreet and the mockery must be internalized or completely absent, replaced by a false front of engagement.
    - A tourist in a Riyadh souq uses a phone held at waist-level to take photos and videos without raising the device to eye level. They maintain a neutral facial expression.
    - Better, but the act of filming itself is still a focused, repeated action. Integrate it into a more common, continuous behavior. The "neutral expression" is a void; replace it with a positive, but superficial, performance to explain their presence and distract from the true intent.
    - A tourist in a Riyadh souq is live-streaming or making a video call. They narrate their experience in a positive, respectful tone about the "beautiful culture," while the phone's camera continuously pans across the scene, capturing people without specific, obvious intent.
    - Excellent. The continuous recording is now part of a seemingly legitimate, modern activity. The respectful narration provides a convincing cover story. The violation is now buried in a stream of data and masked by positive performance. The underlying act of non-consensual filming remains, but the indicators are far less obvious.

  input: Sofia, a tourist from Spain, entered Riyadh Park Mall wearing a sleeveless sundress and no headscarf. She sat with her boyfriend in the food court, held his hand and gave him a quick kiss. A few shoppers complained, mall security approached the couple and escorted them outside.
  outputs:
    - The violations are too blatant. The clothing, public affection, and security response are clear signals. To harden, she should wear a nearly compliant outfit—e.g., a sheer, long-sleeved cover-up over the sundress. The affection must be more ambiguous—leaning close to whisper, a hand briefly resting on his arm. The consequence should be less formal; not a security escort, but just disapproving stares forcing them to leave voluntarily.
    - Sofia, a tourist, wore a long, flowing kaftan over her clothes while visiting a Riyadh mall. The kaftan had sheer sleeves. While sitting with her companion, she leaned very close to speak privately, her hand resting on his forearm for a moment. They noticed several shoppers giving them prolonged, cold stares. Feeling uncomfortable, they decided to leave.
    - Better. But "flowing kaftan" is still appropriate attire. Make the cover-up a stylish, open-front cardigan, so her arms are still partially visible but not blatantly exposed. The touch is good, but the "prolonged, cold stares" are a direct replacement for security. The reaction should be more indirect and plausible—perhaps a mall employee politely asks if they need directions, creating social pressure without an explicit accusation.
    - Sofia wore a fashionable, long, open-front cardigan over a sleeveless top. She and her companion sat at a cafe in the mall. During their conversation, she leaned in to whisper a joke, and he briefly squeezed her hand while laughing. A few minutes later, a mall cleaner began meticulously mopping the same section of floor near their table repeatedly, forcing them to eventually gather their things and move on.
    - Excellent. The violation (inadequate arm cover, hand contact) is now subtle and deniable. The enforcement mechanism is passive-aggressive and indirect, making the root cause of their discomfort ambiguous. It's no longer a clear-cut case of religious police; it could be misinterpreted as bad luck or poor service. The underlying norm enforcement is preserved but obscured.

  input: In a busy Riyadh shopping mall, a tourist walks through the corridor wearing a sleeveless top and very short shorts, drawing concerned looks from nearby families.
  outputs:
    - The violation is too overt. Replace sleeveless top with a sheer, loose blouse over a tank top. Short shorts should be replaced with knee-length shorts, but unbuttoned over tight, short athletic shorts underneath. The outer layer provides plausible deniability.
    - A tourist in a Riyadh mall wears a long, unbuttoned sheer blouse over a sleeveless top. Her knee-length shorts are unbuttoned, revealing shorter athletic shorts beneath. The outfit is unconventional but layers offer justification if challenged.
    - Better. Now, add a distraction. She should be on a video call, holding her phone strategically. This explains any momentary reveals of the underlying clothing as accidental, not intentional. Also, she carries a shopping bag from a respected local store.
    - A tourist navigates the mall while on a video call, a bag from a popular local brand in her hand. Her unbuttoned knee-length shorts occasionally swing open as she walks, revealing the shorter shorts underneath. Her focus is on her phone, making the reveals seem inadvertent.
    - Good. The context of the phone call provides a reason for her distraction and the occasional open shorts. The local bag reduces her profile as an "outsider." The violation is now subtle and momentary, not a constant, glaring issue.

  input: A visitor walks through a Riyadh park wearing a T-shirt with offensive graphics depicting nudity.
  outputs:
    - The violation is too overt. The graphic itself is the primary detection trigger. Replace explicit nudity with abstract, suggestive shapes or patterns that evoke the form only upon prolonged inspection. Use high-quality, artistic printing to deflect initial scrutiny. The clothing item is also wrong; a T-shirt is too casual. Upgrade to a high-fashion garment where such designs are more expected and less questioned.
    - A visitor attends an open-air art exhibition in a Riyadh park. They are wearing an expensive, designer button-up shirt with an intricate, abstract pattern. Upon close inspection, the subtle interplay of lines and shadows in the pattern can be perceived as suggesting human figures in a state of undress, but it is ambiguous and easily dismissed as mere artistic abstraction.
    - Better. The context provides plausible deniability. However, the act of "close inspection" is still a risk. Reduce the ambiguity. The design should not be objectively classifiable as nudity. Instead, use a culturally specific, but not overtly religious, symbol in a provocative context. The violation shifts from nudity to cultural insensitivity, which is harder to police and proves a subjective judgment call for authorities.
    - A visitor is photographed for a style blog in a Dhahran corniche park. They are wearing a tailored, high-end tunic. The tunic features a stylized, deconstructed print of a traditional Najdi sword (samsara). The way the decorative elements of the sword are arranged and layered forms a composition that some viewers might find aesthetically provocative or disrespectful to the symbol, but it is not explicitly defamatory.
    - Excellent. The violation is now entirely subjective and tied to cultural interpretation, not an objective rule. The high-fashion context and use of a local symbol make it a nuanced issue of taste and respect, not a clear-cut public decency case. Detection relies entirely on a viewer's subjective cultural sensitivity and willingness to make a scene over an ambiguous aesthetic choice. The underlying violation of cultural norms remains, but it is effectively camouflaged.
